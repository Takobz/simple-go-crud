# Simple Go REST API.
A simple Go REST API web application for learning how to build a web api using [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/).

## What the Web API Does.
The Web API exposes cability to act on notes. Notes are entities that track actions that a user is interested in. A note can have comments by other users (similar to posts). The notes can also have reactions. A user can invite other users to either: edit, view and even delete the notes.  

### Technologies Used
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for containerizing.
- MySQL for persistance.
- OAuth for auth - ?? maybe ??
